# Project Description
# When this script runs (presumably around 4am on RPi reboot), it should do a few things:
# 1) Go to Trello Board and download existing routines
# 2) Wait until wake-detection-trigger
# 3) Ask for today's routine, provide list of options
# 4) Accept instruction, then coach through day
# 5) At Wind-Down, send link for 5min evening. (The reason we're here afterall)
# Imports
import time
# Setup/Import of data, variables, paths
# Collecting some config variables
# Setting up other simple local variables
